; This is an example script I've created for davinci resolve porting over some similar functionality I use
; in my premiere scripts. Things aren't as clean and there may be better ways to do things
; keep in mind I don't use resolve and I've just cooked this up as an example for you to mess with yourself

;		keyboard shortcut replacements (this is just to make things similar to how I use premiere. Realistically replacing their keybinds in Resolve itself is FAR better)
;=========================================================
; ///// these all assume you're using resolve's default keybinds

q::+[ ; reassign shift[ to ripple start to playhead ;...or assign it to q
w::+] ; reassign shift] to ripple start to playhead ;...or assign it to w
~s::^\ ; ctrl \ is how to split tracks in resolve ;needs ~ or you can't save lmao. likely better to just remap in resolve
XButton2::MButton ; middle mouse is how you normally scroll horizontally in resolve, middle mouse is obnoxious to press though
WheelRight::Down

;change "normal edit mode" to v to make it like premiere
;change "blade edit mode" to c to make it like how I use premiere

;		Drag and Drop Effect Presets
;
;=========================================================
!g::REffect("openfx", "gaussian blur") ;hover over a track on the timeline, press this hotkey, then watch as ahk drags that "favourite" onto the hovered track. Check MS_functions.ahk for the preset code
; this is set up as a preset so you can easily add further hotkeys with 1 line and new defined coords. x (80 in this example) will always remain the same, so just grab the new y coords and you've added a new macro

;=========================================================
;
;		better timeline movement (don't use rightclick, you'll lose context menus)
