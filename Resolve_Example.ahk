; 							THIS SCRIPT IS FOR v2.0 OF AUTOHOTKEY
;				 				IT WILL NOT RUN IN v1.1
;
; ==================================================================================================
;
; This script was created by Tomshi (https://www.youtube.com/c/tomshiii, https://www.twitch.tv/tomshi)
; Its purpose is to port over similar macros from my "My Scripts.ahk" to allow faster editing within resolve for you non adobe editors
; You are free to modify this script to your own personal uses/needs
; Please give credit to the foundation if you build on top of it, otherwise you're free to do as you wish

#HotIf

;any code you want to run all the time should go here

; ALL PIXEL VALUES WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IF YOU AREN'T USING A 1440p MONITOR (AND MIGHT STILL EVEN IF YOU ARE)

; ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

; This is an example script I've created for davinci resolve porting over some similar functionality I use
; in my premiere scripts. Things aren't as clean and there may be better ways to do things
; keep in mind I don't use resolve and I've just cooked this up as an example for you to mess with yourself

#HotIf WinActive(editors.Resolve.winTitle)

;=========================================================
;		keyboard shortcut replacements (this is just to make things similar to how I use premiere. Realistically replacing their keybinds in Resolve itself is FAR better)
;=========================================================
; ///// these all assume you're using resolve's default keybinds

q::+[ ; reassign shift[ to ripple start to playhead ;...or assign it to q
w::+] ; reassign shift] to ripple start to playhead ;...or assign it to w
~s::^\ ; ctrl \ is how to split tracks in resolve ;needs ~ or you can't save lmao. likely better to just remap in resolve
XButton2::MButton ; middle mouse is how you normally scroll horizontally in resolve, middle mouse is obnoxious to press though
WheelRight::Down
WheelLeft::Up
;change "normal edit mode" to v to make it like premiere
;change "blade edit mode" to c to make it like how I use premiere
;change "ripple delete" to shift c to make it like how I use premiere

;=========================================================
;		hold and drag (or click)
;=========================================================
F1::resolve.valhold("zoom", 60, 1) ;press then hold F1 and drag to increase/decrese x position. Let go of F1 to confirm. Tap to reset
F2::resolve.valhold("position", 80, 1) ;press then hold F2 and drag to increase/decrese x position. Let go of F2 to confirm. Tap to reset
F3::resolve.valhold("position", 210, 1) ;press then hold F3 and drag to increase/decrese y position. Let go of F3 to confirm. Tap to reset
F4::resolve.valhold("rotation", 240, 0) ;press then hold F4 and drag to increase/decrese rotation. Let go of F4 to confirm. Tap to reset

;=========================================================
;		flips
;=========================================================
!h::resolve.flip("horizontal") ;flip horizontally. won't do anything if you're scrolled down in the "video" tab already. you could add a wheelup if you wanted
!v::resolve.flip("vertical") ;flip vertically. won't do anything if you're scrolled down in the "video" tab already. you could add a wheelup if you wanted

;=========================================================
;		Scale Adjustments
;=========================================================
^1::resolve.scale(1, "zoom", 60) ;makes the scale of current selected clip 100
^2::resolve.scale(2, "zoom", 60) ;makes the scale of current selected clip 200
^3::resolve.scale(3, "zoom", 60) ;makes the scale of current selected clip 300

;=========================================================
;
;		Drag and Drop Effect Presets
;
;=========================================================
!g::resolve.effect("openfx", "gaussian blur") ;hover over a track on the timeline, press this hotkey, then watch as ahk drags that "favourite" onto the hovered track.
; this is set up as a preset so you can easily add further hotkeys with 1 line and new defined coords.
