# info
This directory is here simply to *assist* other scripts.

- `\images` contains any images scripts use in them (eg. for a gui)
- `changelog.txt` is for the update checker to pull information off github
- `ignore.ini` is for the update checker to know if you want to be prompted or not
- `mouse settings.png` is just a backup of my mouse settings
