# <> Release 2.3.0.1 - Update Checker & Hotfix

###### **_Please note: in this changelog I will be linking to commits, these commits might not be the latest version of said code as things are changing all the time and adding dates would get incredibly confusing, don't copy/paste from these linked commits, check out the current version of the code in the script files themselves._**

- Added [`autosave.ahk`](https://bit.ly/35cbT0Z) to automatically save a premiere file every 5min since adobe refuses to do it properly
- `My Scripts.ahk` now [checks for updates](https://bit.ly/3IBWgyy) on startup to ensure you're on the latest release

## > MS_functions
- Added [logos](https://bit.ly/3fNLQiS) to `switchtoMusic()` & `musicGUI()`
- Added a [missing comment](https://bit.ly/3FSEOUL)
- Fixed `vscode()` as the program now autohides the collapse button if the sidebar isn't in focus

## > Streamdeck AHK
- Moved most `WinMove` in any Streamdeck AHK files to `SD_functions.ahk` to allow for easier adjustment
- Fixed `qss_firefox` scripts so they swap back to [screen coordinate mode](https://bit.ly/3FToQcP) before move the mouse back to the original position

### > Other Changes
- Fixed verbage in `hhmm difference` macro
- `#Include`(d) the right click premiere.ahk file [into `My Scripts.ahk`](https://bit.ly/3qTCBnu) instead of running it separately as I was running into script priority issues every now and then
- Adjusted [`g` macro](https://bit.ly/3AFvpPr) in QMK Keyboard.ahk
- Any `suspend/pause` scripts now [show a tooltip](https://bit.ly/3460tv8) telling you what you enabled or disabled
- All [icon paths](https://bit.ly/3nYtAYJ) now use `A_WorkingDir` instead of full paths
