All `editor` imagesearch files are split into version folders to both ensure the user is aware that they're only guaranteed to work on that version, but also to potentially support multiple versions in the future.

If you have (complete) images for other versions feel free to create a pull request on github to potentially get it added to the supported versions!

That was the idea anyway. I haven't really come up with a solution on how to serve multiple versions at the same time without needing to store multiple copies of the same file but for now that's what I'll do I guess considering they're so small

_v22.3.1-v23.6 has been left as its own directory as I had to make some new images between v23.6-v24.1 but I don't know if that was due to a change or if I broke something
