;//! - I NO LONGER RUN THIS SCRIPT SEPARATELY. I was running into issues with scripts loading after this one and it then breaking so to compensate I run it WITHIN the `My Scripts.ahk` so it never breaks -Tomshi


; Please note this script was originally written by taran in ahk v1.1 so any of his comment ramblings will go on about code that might not function in ahk v2.0 -Tomshi
; A lot of this script has been adapted and changed by me, keeping track of it all has gotten too confusing and convoluted. Feel free to check out TaranVH on githhub to see his version of this script for ahk v1.1 -Tomshi

;THIS IS A GREAT FIRST SCRIPT FOR AHK NOOBS! IT WORKS WITH VERY LITTLE SETUP. JUST READ THE STUFF BELOW! YAY!
;VIDEO EXPLANATION:  https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY?t=23m40s

; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
; NOTE!!
; YOU MUST ASSIGN ALL VARIABLES THAT START WITH `KSA.` with their proper values within `KSA.ini`
; THESE THEN ALSO NEED TO BE SET CORRECTLY WITHIN PREMIERE TO WORK CORRECTLY

;NOTE: This does not, and cannot work on the timeline where there are no tracks visible.
;Explanation: https://twitter.com/boxrNathan/status/927371468371103745

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;First, we define all the timeline's DEFAULT possible colors.
;(Note that your colors will be different if you changed the UI brightness inside preferences > appearance > brightness.)
;I used Window Spy (it comes with AHK) to detect the exact colors onscreen.
timeline1 := 0x414141 ;timeline color inbetween two clips inside the in/out points ON a targeted track
timeline2 := 0x313131 ;timeline color of the separating LINES between targeted AND non targeted tracks inside the in/out points
timeline3 := 0x1b1b1b ;the timeline color inside in/out points on a NON targeted track
timeline4 := 0x212121 ;the color of the bare timeline NOT inside the in out points (potentially a different version/colour as it doesn't line up with anything for me)
timeline8 := 0x202020 ;the color of the bare timeline NOT inside the in out points (v22.3.1)
timeline9 := 0x1C1C1C ;the color of the bare timeline NOT inside the in out points (v23.1)
timeline5 := 0xDFDFDF ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, NOT in the in/out points
timeline6 := 0xE4E4E4 ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on a TARGETED track
timeline7 := 0xBEBEBE ;the color of a SELECTED blank space on the timeline, IN the in/out points, on an UNTARGETED track

playhead := 0x2D8CEB ;the colour of the playhead
timelineCol := [] ;here we'll just create an array that encapsulates all of the above timeline colours to make things a little easier to keep track of
loop {
	if !IsSet(%"timeline" A_Index%)
		break
	timelineCol.Push(Format("{:#x}", %"timeline" A_Index%))
}

;--------EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE WILL ONLY WORK INSIDE PREMIERE PRO!----------

	;//! this code block until `skip:` is getting & storing the x/y values of the timeline
	;we do this so we can check later if the playhead is currently on the screen - if it is we'll do a shuttle stop
	;if it isn't we won't
	;the reason we don't want to if the playhead isn't on the screen is because if you hit shuttlestop when it's not
	;your view of the timeline will snap to the playhead

This code should work regardless of where you have the timeline (if you make you're timeline comically small you may encounter issues)

/**
 * This function is to help stop the Ctrl/Shift modifier from getting stuck which can sometimes happen while using this script. Testing for this is difficult and as such, this function may slowly change over time.
 * This function is necessary because some of the hotkeys used in the code above include the Ctrl modifier (^)/Shift modifier (+) - if interupted, this modifier can get placed in a "stuck" state where it will remain "pressed"
 * You may be able to avoid needing this function by simply using hotkeys that do not use modifiers.
