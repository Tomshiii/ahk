# <> Release 2.15.0 - Features & Stability
This release brings along with it a few breaking changes, mostly centered around `PremiereRemote`. Be sure to read the instructions down below if you've been using my repo previously to ensure you do not run into any roadblocks.

> [!Important]
> If the user has previously used `PremiereRemote` with my scripts this version will require them to copy all relevent files in `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\` and replace the corresponding files in `A_AppData "\Adobe\CEP\extensions\PremiereRemote\` or alternatively run `...\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replacePremRemote.ahk`.

> [!Caution]
> If the user uses `UIA` with `Premiere` functions, a new `KSA` value for `Source Monitor` is required to be set.

## Functions
- Fixed `clip.search()` not working when highlighting multiple words
- Fixed `settingsGUI()` not visually tracking if the user interacted with the `Is Beta Version?` checkbox
- Added `clipStorage {` - a class of functions designed to store/send strings
- `keys.allWait()` will now properly handle when the activation hotkey is multiple modifiers (ie <kbd>^!f::</kbd>)
- `getHotkeys()` will now return `false` in the event that two individual hotkeys cannot be determined
- `ffmpeg.__getChannels()` => `ffmpeg.__getAudioStream()`
    - Will now return the entire Map instead of just the `channels` property
    - Now accepts parameter `stream` to manually choose which stream of the file to check
- `generateAdobeShortcut()` will now return `false` if the intended file directory does not exist. This is to stop the function generating dead shortcuts if the user has the wrong version selected

`startup {`
- Fixed `updatePackages()` throwing if a package manager isn't installed
- `adobeVerOverride()` will now show the user the currently selected Adobe versions. This functionality can be toggled in `settingsGUI()`

`switchTo {`
- `Premiere()` & `Photoshop()` now accept parameter `switchBetween` to determine whether you wish for the function to cycle between the main/beta versions of the program if they are both open
- `__adobeSwitch()` & `AE()` will now alert the user using `Notify {` if there is an error attempting to run the desired shortcut
- `adobeProject()` will now better handle activating the correct window when multiple windows with the same name exist

`prem {`
- Added `dismissWarning()`
- Added `dragSourceMon()`
- Added `flattenAndColour()`
- Fixed `__remoteFunc()` spamming logs on success
- `wheelEditPoint()` now sends `ksa.shuttleStop` before proceeding with the rest of the function
- `swapChannels()` now accepts parameter `adjustGain` & `changeLabel`
    - Should now better handle when a clip has two channels that are set to opposite pans
- `numpadGain()` now needs to be activated with <kbd>NumpadSub</kbd>/<kbd>NumpadAdd</kbd>
    - Can now alternatively adjust a clip's `level` by pressing <kbd>NumpadMult</kbd> after hotkey activation  
    
> [!Important]
> To take advantage of this new `numpadGain()` feature; the user will need to follow the instructions at the top of this changelog as it requires adjusted `PremiereRemote` functions.

`rbuttonPrem {`  
- `movePlayhead()`
    - Fixed function always sending <kbd>RButton</kbd> on fallback even if it wasn't the activation key
        - Now accepts parameter `sendOnFailure` to determine what keys to send on fallback
    - Uses new function `dismissWarning()` to automatically close any warning windows that appear to stop the function from highlighting the incorrect panel and sending inputs to the wrong place  
    *(This was mostly to deal with a bug in the then current beta build of Premiere that would spam you with audio IO error windows constantly. This does not seem to be an issue anymore in the current beta builds but as it isn't the first time it's popped up I'm sure it'll come back at some point)*

## PremiereRemote
- Added `sourceMonName()`
    - Required adding `getProjectItem()` to `PremierePro.14.0.d.ts`
- Added `setBarsAndTone()`

## Other Changes
- Added `resetTimecode.ahk`
- Added `revealInExplorer.ahk`
- `pcTimerShutdown.ahk` can now optionally schedule a `Sleep` instead
> [!Note]
> This feature is only available if the user downloads `PSTools` from Microsoft and places the contents of that package in their `A_WinDir \System32\` folder. This is a limitation of windows as there is no clean way to schedule a sleep without this tool.

`Premiere_UIA.ahk`
- Fixed `__setNewVal()` locking up the user's inputs if it attempts to fire before a project is opened
- Will now additionally check for the `Source Monitor`

`KSA`
- Added `sourceMonitor`
- Added `modifyStartTime`
- Added `revealExplorer`
