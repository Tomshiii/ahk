# <> Release 2.14 - PremiereRemote, Premiere_UIA & Installation
This release brings about quite a few large and sweeping changes that expand on the functionality of the repo while also offering a few QOL improvements.

> [!Caution]
> Most of the changes in this update are breaking changes. It is recommended you do a clean installation of my repo if you intend on upgrading to this version.
***
## ‣ PremiereRemote
This release brings along support for [`PremiereRemote`](https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote), a tool by [`sebinside`](https://github.com/sebinside) that allows the user to easily interact with [`Adobe Premiere's Extension mechanism`](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP).  
This tool offers multiple advantages for my repo, such as;  
- More directly telling Premiere to `save` resulting in less issues
- Directly change clip properties like `zoom`, `x/y`, `anchor point`, etc. Meaning less keystrokes needing to be sent
- Directly receive the current project path

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use of `PremiereRemote` requires additional setup from the user so make sure you checkout the [wiki page](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki/PremiereRemote) to get started.

#### PremiereRemote related changes
- `winGet.ProjPath()` can now retrieve the project directory directly from Premiere without needing string manipulation
- `autosave.ahk` can now tell Premiere to save directly
- Added `openPremRemote.ahk` to quickly reopen the `PremiereRemote` extenstion within premiere.
    - **note: custom amount of "{Down}" will need to be set by the user*
- Added `openRemoteDir.ahk` to open the `A_AppData \Adobe\CEP\extensions\PremiereRemote\` directory
- Added `resetNPM.ahk` to rerun the `npm run build` command in the `A_AppData \Adobe\CEP\extensions\PremiereRemote\host\` directory
- Added `installPremRemote.ahk` that is optionally called during the new installation process.
    - **note: NodeJS must already be installed before this script will proceed.*

`Prem {`
- Added `__checkPremRemoteDir()` to check for the existence of the `PremiereRemote` extension
- Added `__checkPremRemoteFunc()` to check for the requested function to ensure it's callable
- Added `__remoteFunc()` to call functions for `PremiereRemote`
- Added `save()` to call the custom `saveProj` function and directly tell premiere to save instead of requiring keystrokes
- `zoom()` can now directly set the properties without needing to send keystrokes
- `Previews()` now attempts to use `save()` for a more reliable experience
***

## ‣ Premiere_UIA
This release brings exciting (but breaking) changes to `Premiere_UIA.ahk` and its use/functionality within the repo.
- `UIA` values are now stored in `..\Support Files\UIA\values.ini` instead of the class itself
    - Values are now stored in a `JSON` string instead of an ahk object
- Class must now be initialised before it can be used in another script
- `premUIA_Values {` can now automatically fill out UIA values by focusing each panel within `Premiere` and retrieving the UIA path
- `premUIA_Values(false).__setNewVal()` can be called to automatically generate new data for the currently set `Premiere` version
    - Class will automatically attempt to generate new data under certain circomstances
- `Set Prem_UIA values` can be selected from the `My Scripts.ahk` tray menu to automatically set new UIA values for the currently set `Premiere` version

> [!Tip]
> Checkout the updated [wiki](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki/UIA) page to learn more about these changes!
***

## ‣ Better Installation process of my repo
This release also offers a new and improved installation process which takes more of the work off the user to handle it systematically instead. The installation process should now be more akin to any other program you install on windows.

> [!Tip]
> Check the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki/Installation) for more details.
***
# ‣ Further Changelog
## Functions
- Added `startup.adobeVerOverride()` which can optionally set the current `Premiere Pro`/`After Effects` version based off the user's current installed version instead of needing to manually be set.
    - **note: if the user wishes to use a beta version, the beta toggle must first be set and then the function must be rerun*
- Added `FileGetExtendedProp()` a function by `neogna2` to get extended properties of files/folders
- Fixed `switchTo.AE()` generating a shortcut using `UserSettings.prem_year` instead of `ae_year`
- Fixed `move.Window()` throwing in the event you try to minimize the active window the same moment it changes (and can no longer be found. eg opening a new browser tab)
- `cmd.result()` now accepts parameter `workingDir` to pass the working dir to `pipeCommand()` if parameter `hide` is set to `true`
- `prem.screenshot()` will now generate the dropdown list automatically using all filenames in `..\Streamdeck AHK\screenshots\`
    - **note: values will still need to be manually added to `WM {` however*

`settingsGUI()`
- Added option to enable/disable `startup.adobeVerOverride()`
- Added option to set `autosave.ahk` to always save or only save if the current program is the active window

## > Streamdeck AHK
- Fixed `reencode_prores_all.ahk` not doing anything
- `extractAll.ahk` now has protection against command growing too large

`2stereoTO1mono.ahk`
- Fixed script ignoring user input if a file already exists and the user chooses `Yes` in the dialogue box
- Now has protection against command growing too large

## > Other Changes
- Added [`WinEvent.ahk`](https://github.com/Descolada/AHK-v2-libraries/blob/main/Lib/WinEvent.ahk) by [Descolada](https://github.com/Descolada/)
    - `autodismiss error.ahk` now uses `WinEvent {`
- Added [SystemThemeAwareTooltip.ahk](https://github.com/nperovic/SystemThemeAwareToolTip) by [nperovic](https://github.com/nperovic)
    - `tool.cust()` now uses `SystemThemeAwareTooltip {` to set dark/lightmode tooltips as well as rounding them for win11
    - `Startup {` tooltips will now be coloured based off the system theme
- Now backing up `.prlabelpreset` file in `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\Labels\`
- `checklist.ahk` now better handles my project folder paths
- `v24.3` of `Premiere` is now its own folder in `ImageSearch` as it contains UI changes

`adobeKSA.ahk`
- Fixed a bug that caused it to incorrectly set the default directory path for `After Effects`
- Patched a few instances of functions receiving blank variables - this is likely caused by a deeper issue and this bandaid solution has likely made things worse in the long run

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.0.1 - Hotfix
- This version fixes an incorrect assumption that Premiere `v24.3` would include UI changes which resulted in a folder existing that shouldn't.

> [!Caution]
> If the user has already installed Release `v2.14` of this repo, and does not migrate to this version, they may encounter issues with a few scripts that search for the `Proxy` icon within Premiere. Other than that nothing else should be affected.

- Fixed `vidSelect.ahk` no longer working
***

`Premiere_RightClick.ahk`
- Fixed script indefinitely holding onto the playhead if the user quickly tapped <kbd>RButton</kbd> while the cursor was close to it
- Revert addition of `MouseHook {` as it was causing additional issues

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.2 - Rudimentary NVENC Support
> [!Note]
> Support for NVNEC across my scripts is not universal, only the main scripts get its addition. Some other scripts (ie. the crop scripts) will no be receiving these changes (at least in this release)

## > Functions
- Fixed `startup.adobeTemp()` failing to delete anything
- Added `Win32_VideoController()` by `jNizM` to get information about the user's GPU
- Added `useNVENC()` to rudimentarily determine whether the user can use NVENC encoding
- Reverted `winget.ProjPath()` using `PremiereRemote` to retrieve the current project path as it causes the function to silently throw in the event that `Premiere` isn't currently responding

`ffmpeg {`
- Fixed `__getFrequency()` not correctly determining the amount of audio tracks
- `reencode_h26x()` now has rudimentary `nvenc` support
    - `reencodeGUI` will now also offer basic GPU rendering options

`prem {`
- Fixed `Previews()` failing to make a save attempt if the user wasn't using `PremiereRemote`
- Fixed `zoomPreviewWindow()` stopping the user from using <kbd>!</kbd>, <kbd>@</kbd> or <kbd>#</kbd> while the project window was active or while interacting with a different GUI within Premiere (ie. naming a nested sequence)
- Added `saveAndFocusTimeline()` to cut repeat code
    - `render and replace.ahk` now uses this code to lower the frequence of sequences being cycled

`premUIA_Values {`
- Will now additionally set the `project window`
- Will now alert the user if a value hasn't been set (ie. if they update the script without setting new values)

## > Streamdeck AHK
- `lock` scripts now allow the user to select a range of tracks to toggle by first pressing `NumpadDiv`
    - Each selection will either wait for two numbers to be pressed or for the user to press <kbd>NumpadEnter</kbd> between each selection

`download` scripts
- Now include `--verbose` to give a more detailed output to the commandline
- Now do a rudimentary check for `NVENC` and will render using it if available

## > Other changes

`autosave.ahk`
- Fixed script failing to make a save attempt if the user wasn't using `PremiereRemote`
- Identified an occurrence of the script silently crashing in the background, causing <kbd>ctrl + s</kbd> to no longer work

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.3 - QoL & Hotfix

## Functions
- Fixed `run at startup` checkbox in `settingsGUI()` throwing
- Fixed `ffmpeg().all_XtoY()` passing too many paramaters to `__determineFrameRate()`
- Added `startup.updatePackages()` to check for updates with the user's respective Package Manager
> [!Important]
> The code for this function (especially the portion that sends the command to actually update packages) is specifically designed for `Chocolatey`. While there are paramaters for the function to customise it for your package manager of choice, it may not function completey as intend. Feel free to open an issue/pr detailing as much as you can if you encounter any issues and rudimentary support for additional package managers may be considered (though not guaranteed)  
> Alternatively you can simply alter the code for your package manager of choice
- `premUIA_Values().__setNewVal()` now prompts the user to reload scripts

`prem {`
- `numpadGain()` should now move clips on the timeline less often
- `previews()` (& `render and replace.ahk`) will now reattempt to send the hotkey `once` if the timeline was the originally focused panel
- `gain()`, `mousedrag()` & `screenshot()` now all use `UIA {` when they need to focus the timeline
- `__uiaCtrlPos()` now accepts parameter `getActive` to determine whether you wish for the function to retrieve the active panel or not

`rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()`
- Now uses `WinEvent` to halt the function as soon as the main Premiere window is no longer active
- Now focuses the timeline using `UIA {`
- Now checks that the initially active sequence is still the active sequence when the function is finished
> [!Note]
> All of these changes should help in reducing the frequency of the function causing Premiere to cycle sequences (for example if the function was activated/active while the save dialog window appears, or if the user activated the function during an `autosave.ahk` save attempt)

## PremiereRemote
- Added `getActiveSequence()` & `focusSequence()`

## Other Changes
- Fixed `screenshot` streamdeck scripts failing to work if the timeline isn't the focused panel
- Fixed some `Not Editor.ahk` scripts not firing under certain conditions
- Added `swap solo.ahk`
- Separated `Premiere` `v24.3` ImageSearch images back into their own folder
    - It has come to my attention that at some point between `v22.3.1` the `track` images have changed. Little things like this can go unnoticed for long periods of time unfortunately
- `ptf.MainScriptName` is now tracked in `settings.ini` instead to remove some friction when installing new versions of the repo
    - This value will now automatically get set when using `startup.generate()` in a user's custom `Main Script`
- Installation process will now replace previous `PremiereRemote` function files with updated versions if the user has `PremiereRemote` already installed
    - It will also backup the previous files in `A_AppData "\Adobe\CEP\extensions\PremiereRemote\host\src\backup\"`

`autosave.ahk`
- Now checks the originally focused panel using `UIA {` and uses that to later determine if it needs to attempt to refocus the timeline
- Now attempts to use `UIA {` to focus the timeline before falling back to previous methods
> [!Note]
> These changes should help in reducing the frequency of the function causing Premiere to cycle sequences if it attempts to refocus the timeline at the end of its save attempt

# <> Release 2.14.4 - Hotfix

## Functions
- Fixed `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` performing slowly under certain circumstances
- Fixed `slack.__expandingLoop()` throwing

`prem {`
- Fixed `delayPlayback()` setting its timer when the timeline wasn't the active window (which would make typing text a little difficult)
- `Previews()` will now check to see if a save is necessary instead of always saving

## Other Changes
- `render and replace.ahk` will now check to see if a save is necessary instead of always saving

# <> Release 2.14.5 - Initial Adobe Spectrum UI Support
This release brings initial support for the new Premiere Pro & After Effects `Spectrum UI` currently being tested in the beta channels. Be aware that, as it is currently in beta, things may continue to change in the future as they lead up to its release in a few months. As such my scripts may lag behind in support as a result.  

It should also be noted that while the current UI overhaul originated in the `v24.5` betas, there is no guarantee that will be the version it launches in (colour label changes were initially in the premiere `v24.3` beta but pushed to `v24.4` for example, and the Premiere beta version has now moved to `v24.6` since I started on this release), because of this, the user should be aware that the `ImageSearch` folders in `..\Support Files\ImageSearch\Premiere` may not be completely accurate after this release and adobe may continue to change things which will cause issues with the `ImageSearch` folder structure if the UI changes happen at a different point.  
I will of course release further updates to rectify any of this issues as they crop up but the user should be aware these fixes may be delayed and it might end up being faster to quicky fix them themselves.

> [!Important]
> It should be noted that in the current beta versions of Premiere Pro, adobe has removed the WinTitle from the `"delete existing keyframes"` window. This change completely breaks `autodismiss error.ahk` and unless adobe reverts this change, this script will no longer be able to function.

## Functions
- Fixed `prem.preset()` potentially throwing if it cannot determine the position of the caret
- Removed `ae.valuehold()` & `ae.preset()`

`rbuttonPrem {`
- Now supports both; The current UI colours, and the new `Spectrum UI` found in current beta builds
    - Timeline colour values have been taken out of this class and placed in their own class `timelineColours {` to tidy things up and add easier support for multiple UI versions
- `movePlayhead()` now requires an additional parameter `version` to tell the function which version of `Premiere` is set within `settingsGUI()`
    - Now also takes additional parameter `theme` to use a different theme than the default `darkest`. However, doing so will require the user to add additional colour values to `timelineColours {` for their desired theme as I only maintain `darkest`. Feel free to pull request other themes back to the repo!
- The `sleep` in the main `while` loop of `movePlayhead()` has been doubled to give premiere time to catch up from the sea of inputs it's receiving. The extra delay isn't visually percievable

`prem {`
- `prem.selectionTool()` & `prem.screenshot()` now properly block user inputs when they're supposed to
- Now stores `UserSettings.premVer` as `currentSetVer` so that `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` can more easily use it as a parameter
- Removed `audioDrag()`

## Other Changes
- Removed a lot of old `Premiere` & `After Effects` `ImageSearch` files that are no longer used in any functions
- `swap solo.ahk` will now properly retrieve the coordinates of the timeline if the `Main Script` doesn't have them yet

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.6 - Hotfix
- Fix a bug in `startup.adobeVerOverride()` that caused any subsequent startup scripts to no longer run
    - As a result this release also includes a bunch of third party lib updates

## Functions
- Removed `prem.wordBackspace()`
- Added `prem.swapChannels()` by taking code from `swapChannels.ahk`

## Other Changes
- Added `Notify.ahk` by `XMCQCX`
    - `autosave.ahk`, `premUIA_Values().__setNewVal()` & `prem.getTimeline()` now use `notify {` instead of `tool.Cust()` for a cleaner user experience
    - `startup.libUpdateCheck()` currently checks against a fork I created but will be adjusted back to the main branch once it supports center aligning text

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.7 - Hotfix

## Functions
- Fixed `startup.adobeVerOverride()` failing to determine beta exe paths correctly & causing a boot loop
- `getLocalVer()` now accepts parameter `returnObj` to determine whether to return the version number of a script as a string, or whether to return an object containing both the version number & the entire contents of the target script
    - `startup.libUpdateCheck()` now uses this function instead of repeating code
        - Fixes `startup.libUpdateCheck()` sometimes incorrectly determining version numbers
- `startup.libUpdateCheck()` now uses `Notify {` in a few cases

`settingsGUI()`
- Fixed the bottom checkboxes getting cut off
- Fixed function throwing if the user attempts to open the `Photoshop` dropdown menu

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.8 - Bugfix & QoL Update
- Fixed references/functions/filepaths that assumed `v24.5` was going to be the `Spectrum UI` update

## Functions
- Fixed `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` attempting to use `PremiereRemote` every use even if it's been determined to not be working correctly
- Fixed `settingsGUI()` setting adobe `beta` values as `0/1` instead of `true/false`
- Fixed `generateAdobeShortcut()` incorrectly generating `After Effects Beta` shortcut
- `winget.PremName()` & `winget.AEName()` now accept parameter `ttips` to determine whether tooltips will display if the window titles cannot be determined
- `SD_Opt {` now contains function `checkCount()` to ensure all currently available options have been set in the user's `options.ini` file
- `ytdlp().download()` will now increment the filename if it already exists
- `useNVENC()` will now properly detect nvidia gpus if the user has integrated graphics

`switchTo {`
- `AE()`
    - Should now more reliably bring After Effects into focus
    - Will now focus `Mocha` if it exists

`Prem {`
- Fixed `getTimeline()` not properly accounting for a different column size left of the timeline on the new `Spectrum UI`
- `swapChannels()` will now work for 2 track files assuming you want all media channels to use the same stereo pair

`startup {`
- Added `startup.createShortcuts()` to check if shortcuts have been generated
    - Added `createShortcuts.ahk` to help with this process or to allow the user to generate them manually (fixes `New Premiere.ahk` throwing in the event of no shortcuts)
- Fixed `current function` tooltip from showing when the function variable is blank

## Other Changes
- Updated `Notify.ahk` now that text alignment is a native feature
- Added `vidPart.ahk` & `audPart.ahk` to automate downloading specific timecodes of youtube videos
- Added `checkInstalls.ahk` to check `PremiereRemote` files
- Wrapped all uses of `JSON.Parse()` in `try` blocks to hopefully stop some instances of scripts locking up in the event that they don't retrieve the data they need
- `reencodeGUI()` will now prompt the user asking if they'd like to attempt to force GPU rendering if it rudimentarily determines GPU rendering isn't available

`autosave.ahk`
- Script attempting to restart playback within `Premiere Pro` after a save attempt can now be enabled/disabled within `settingsGUI()`
- Making `After Effects` opaque should now be more reliable
- Fixed script failing to fall back to alternate save method if `PremiereRemote` server is not functioning correctly

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.9 - Bugfix

## Functions
- Fixed `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` not properly detecting when Premiere is no longer the active window

`settingsGUI()`
- Added Toggles;
    - `Check for AHK Updates` & `Check for Library Updates`
    - `getTimeline() Always Check UIA` & `Limit Daily`
        - Allows the user to determine whether they *always* want to refresh UIA values & whether to limit that check
- Fixed some text overlapping with the `Adjust` edit boxes
- Fixed `values.json` using ahk style formatting instead of json style formatting resulting in newlines not rendering and <kbd>`</kbd> being represented twice

`prem {`
- Fixed `__remoteFunc()` not passing back if it was successful which caused `autosave.ahk` to always fall back to the previous save method causing double saves
- Added more images so `reset()` will fail less on `Spectrum UI`

## Other Changes
- Streamdeck `download` scripts will now play a little sfx to alert the user they are determining the video title

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.14.10 - Bugfix

## Functions
