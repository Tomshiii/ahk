# <> Release 2.15.0 - Features & Stability
This release brings along with it a few breaking changes, mostly centered around `PremiereRemote`. Be sure to read the instructions down below if you've been using my repo previously to ensure you do not run into any roadblocks.

> [!Important]
> If the user has previously used `PremiereRemote` with my scripts this version will require them to copy all relevent files in `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\` and replace the corresponding files in `A_AppData "\Adobe\CEP\extensions\PremiereRemote\` or alternatively run `...\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replacePremRemote.ahk`.

> [!Caution]
> If the user uses `UIA` with `Premiere` functions, a new `KSA` value for `Source Monitor` is required to be set.

## Functions
- Fixed `clip.search()` not working when highlighting multiple words
- Fixed `settingsGUI()` not visually tracking if the user interacted with the `Is Beta Version?` checkbox
- Added `clipStorage {` - a class of functions designed to store/send strings
- `keys.allWait()` will now properly handle when the activation hotkey is multiple modifiers (ie <kbd>^!f::</kbd>)
- `getHotkeys()` will now return `false` in the event that two individual hotkeys cannot be determined
- `ffmpeg.__getChannels()` => `ffmpeg.__getAudioStream()`
    - Will now return the entire Map instead of just the `channels` property
    - Now accepts parameter `stream` to manually choose which stream of the file to check
- `generateAdobeShortcut()` will now return `false` if the intended file directory does not exist. This is to stop the function generating dead shortcuts if the user has the wrong version selected

`startup {`
- Fixed `updatePackages()` throwing if a package manager isn't installed
- `adobeVerOverride()` will now show the user the currently selected Adobe versions. This functionality can be toggled in `settingsGUI()`

`switchTo {`
- `Premiere()` & `Photoshop()` now accept parameter `switchBetween` to determine whether you wish for the function to cycle between the main/beta versions of the program if they are both open
- `__adobeSwitch()` & `AE()` will now alert the user using `Notify {` if there is an error attempting to run the desired shortcut
- `adobeProject()` will now better handle activating the correct window when multiple windows with the same name exist

`prem {`
- Added `dismissWarning()`
- Added `dragSourceMon()`
- Added `flattenAndColour()`
- Fixed `__remoteFunc()` spamming logs on success
- `wheelEditPoint()` now sends `ksa.shuttleStop` before proceeding with the rest of the function
- `swapChannels()` now accepts parameter `adjustGain` & `changeLabel`
    - Should now better handle when a clip has two channels that are set to opposite pans
- `numpadGain()` now needs to be activated with <kbd>NumpadSub</kbd>/<kbd>NumpadAdd</kbd>
    - Can now alternatively adjust a clip's `level` by pressing <kbd>NumpadMult</kbd> after hotkey activation  
    
> [!Important]
> To take advantage of this new `numpadGain()` feature; the user will need to follow the instructions at the top of this changelog as it requires adjusted `PremiereRemote` functions.

`rbuttonPrem {`  
- `movePlayhead()`
    - Fixed function always sending <kbd>RButton</kbd> on fallback even if it wasn't the activation key
        - Now accepts parameter `sendOnFailure` to determine what keys to send on fallback
    - Uses new function `dismissWarning()` to automatically close any warning windows that appear to stop the function from highlighting the incorrect panel and sending inputs to the wrong place  
    *(This was mostly to deal with a bug in the then current beta build of Premiere that would spam you with audio IO error windows constantly. This does not seem to be an issue anymore in the current beta builds but as it isn't the first time it's popped up I'm sure it'll come back at some point)*

## PremiereRemote
- Added `sourceMonName()`
    - Required adding `getProjectItem()` to `PremierePro.14.0.d.ts`
- Added `setBarsAndTone()`

## Other Changes
- Added `resetTimecode.ahk`
- Added `revealInExplorer.ahk`
- `pcTimerShutdown.ahk` can now optionally schedule a `Sleep` instead
> [!Note]
> This feature is only available if the user downloads `PSTools` from Microsoft and places the contents of that package in their `A_WinDir \System32\` folder. This is a limitation of windows as there is no clean way to schedule a sleep without this tool.

`Premiere_UIA.ahk`
- Fixed `__setNewVal()` locking up the user's inputs if it attempts to fire before a project is opened
- Will now additionally check for the `Source Monitor`

`KSA`
- Added `sourceMonitor`
- Added `modifyStartTime`
- Added `revealExplorer`

.

# <> Release 2.15.1 - Bugfix & Improvements

## Functions
- Fixed `generateAdobeShortcut()` not properly generating `Photoshop` shortcuts
- `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead()` will no longer input a bunch of characters if the user is typing when activated
- `switchTo.adobeProject()` should now move any windows it incorrectly activates to the bottom of the stack

`prem {`
- Added `layerSizeAdjust()`
- Added `toggleLayerButtons()`

`startup {`
- `adobeVerOverride()` will now show if you have the beta version selected during the `notify`
- `updatePackages()` will no longer alert the user if only `ignored` updates exist
> [!Note]
> This feature is currently only available if `choco` is the selected package manager

## Other Changes
- Updated use of `notify {` across scripts to make them more consistent
- Updated some `After Effects` ImageSearch images for `v25.1` & `v25.2`
- `Always Check UIA` will now default to `true` during new installs

.

.

.

# <> Release 2.15.2 - QoL Improvements

## Functions
- Added `startup.updateAdobeVerAHK()` to alert the user of updates to the `Vers.ahk`/`adobeVers.ahk` files so that they may select newer versions of adobe programs without needing to wait for a full release
    - Can be toggled in `settingsGUI()`
- Fixed `ytdlp.__activateDir()` failing to activate if the chosen directory is the root folder of a drive
- `trimGUI {` now requires a start/end timecode instead of the user needing to determine the `start time` & `duration` in seconds

`prem {`
- `dragSourceMon("video")` will now work for sources like `Bars and Tone` when the image is different
- `numpadGain()` will now alert the user with a tooltip under certain circumstances if the timeline is not in focus
    - Will now activate if `Effect Controls` is the active window to make keyframing `Levels` more natural
- `toggleLayerButtons()` will now function properly with different layer heights
    - Will now activate even if the `Timeline` is not active, as long as the cursor is within the timeline coordinates
- `wheelEditPoint()` now accepts parameter `checkMButton` which when set to either `true` or an `object` can wait a specified amount of time to ensure the user doesn't click <kbd>MButton</kbd> afterwards (or to ensure it isn't being held). This is useful when panning in `Premiere's` `Program Monitor` when the function is activated using a tilting mouse scroll wheel

`errorLog()`
- Fixed date/time from being printed unintentially at the beginning of the file
- Function can now be called like; `errorLog({state:"empty"})` to generate the initial file

    - Added shortcut to `My Scripts.ahk` tray icon right click menu
- Added `move 1sec.ahk` to move the `Premiere` playhead forwards/backwards by 1 second
    - Added `movePlayhead` as a PremiereRemote function
- `backupProj.ahk` will ask the user if they wish to backup any additional `videos` folders

.

# <> Release 2.15.3 - Features & Bugfixes
> [!Note]
> A bug in the third party lib [`WinEvent`](<https://github.com/Descolada/AHK-v2-libraries/issues/15>) was causing `prem.dissmissWarning()` to never fire when used in `Premiere_RightClick.ahk`. This issue has now been recitified and is once again working as expected.

> [!Caution]
> If the user uses `PremiereRemote` and isn't doing a clean install, this release requires the user to run `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replacePremRemote.ahk` as some functions have been updated.

## Functions
- ✅ Fixed bug with `trimGUI {` calculating the duration between two timecodes causing empty files to be generated
    - Will now warn the user if incorrect timecodes have been given
- ✏️ Added `ffmpeg().adjustGain_db()`, `ffmpeg().adjustGain_loudnorm()` & `ffmpeg().adjustGain_dynAud()`
- ✏️ Added `Reload` option to the `Exit` menu in `settingsGUI()`  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ee0243d-9ad4-45b4-8591-3207a5bd1b5a)  
- `ytdlp.download()` now accepts parameter `URL` to pass in a url string instead of checking the user's clipboard

#### ⚠️ `rbuttonPrem {`
- `movePlayhead()`
    - Will now return early in the event that `A_ThisHotkey` gets set as two keys
    - Fixed user being unable to left click to select a clip while `allChecks` was set to `false`

#### ⚠️ `Prem {`
- ✅ Fixed `dismissWarning()` utilising incorrect coords
- ✏️ Added `disableDirectManip()`
- ❌ Removed `keyreset()` & `keyframe()`. A simpler method could be created using `PremiereRemote` but no current plans to develop said function
- ❌ Removed `zoom()`
- `numpadGain()` may alert the user if setting a new value causes `PremiereRemote` to return an unexpected value
- `valuehold()`
    - No longer requires individual screenshots for each control, greatly simplifying the function and making it less prone to breaking
    - No longer adjusts the `blend mode` and all reference to that ability has been removed
    - No longer adjusts `levels`. That functionality is better left to `numpadGain()`
    - First parameter `filepath` renamed => `control` is now <kbd>Case Sensitive</kbd>

#### ⚠️ `startup {`
- ✏️ Added `gitBranchCheck()` to check for upstream changes to a git branch and offer the ability to `pull` upstream changes
    - Can be toggled in `settingsGUI()` and defaults to `false`
- Moved progress tooltip to the bottom left (previously bottom right) to avoid obscuring any `Notify` alerts
- `libUpdateCheck()` now checks for `Notify Creator.ahk` & `Icons.dll` updates
- Functions that `reload` or `reset` all scripts will now track their reloads to ensure they can only reload once per day
    - They will also all now use `Notify` to alert the user that a reload is taking place to minimise confusion incase multiple need to happen in succession
- `generate()`
    - Fixed function improperly handling when a settings value is removed causing the setting to remain in the user's .ini file
    - Will now attempt a reload if it has added any settings entries

## Streamdeck AHK
- ✏️ Added `updateGitBranch.ahk`
- `backupProj.ahk` now alerts the user once it begins the backup process
- `[aud/vid][Part/Select].ahk` scripts now better manage the clipboard to allow the user to copy/paste before the actual download process begins
- ❌ Removed;
    - `blend` scripts. I never built them out and it may be possible to just use `PremiereRemote` instead but no current plans to investigate or develop said function
    - `swap solo.ahk` and associated `ImageSearch` images. This functionality is better utilised using `prem.toggleLayerButtons("solo")`
    - `push to audition.ahk`, `syncWorkAssets.ahk` & `tiktok voice.ahk`

## Other Changes
- ✏️ Added [`ObjRegisterActive.ahk`](<https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=6148&sid=79f2a3736ebcc2c9b88842b5a5145d27&start=40>)
    - `My Scripts.ahk` can now better share its instance of `prem {` with `QMK.ahk` scripts resulting in less UIA window focusing
- ✏️ Added `adjust audio.ahk` streamdeck script that offers a GUI to quickly and easily adjust the gain of files  
    - <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21633053-66d0-4573-950d-2a0eff825f2c" width="275"/>
- ❌ Removed all obsolete `ImageSearch` images relating to `blend` scripts & `prem.valuehold()`
- ❌ Removed `Premiere Timeline GUI.ahk` and all references to it. The functionality of this script has long since been superseded by `Premiere_UIA.ahk`

# <> Release 2.15.4 - `yt-dlp.ahk` Hotfix
Although this release comes hot off the heels of <kbd>v2.15.3</kbd> I wanted to semi-rush this one out to fix a few mishaps with `yt-dlp.ahk`.

## Functions
- ✅ Fixed `getLocalVer()` returning early

⚠️ `ytdlp {`
- `download()`
    - Fixed function failing if `URL` param isn't passed into the function
    - Fixed function sometimes failing to increment the filename if a video is downloaded multiple times
    - Function will now manually check the codec of the downloaded file, if it isn't `h264` or `h265` it will use an additional command to reencode the downloaded file
        - While previously it more or less already did this, this method will now spawn a new cmdline window which will in turn give the user the live progress of the encode
    - Now accepts parameter `openDirOnFinish` to determine whether to open the destination directory once completed
    - Now accepts parameter `postArgs` to execute cmdline commands after the initial download is complete
        - *Please note:* if a custom arg string is passed to `postArgs` the function will **no longer** do its check to determine if the downloaded file is `h264` or `h265`. The user's custom arg will run regardless.

## Other Changes
- ✏️ Added `delete0kb.ahk`
- ✏️ Added `mult-dl.ahk`

.

    - Function can now adjust the `levels` property in `float` instead of only `int`
        - Will require the user to run `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replacePremRemote.ahk` as `index.tsx` has been adjusted
    - Will clean up the input keys using `regex` instead of outright failing if any other key is pressed accidentally

⚠️ `premUIA_Values {`
- `__setNewVal()`
    - ✅ Fixed function failing if an error window appears during the process
        - Should now use `prem.dismissWarning()` to first remove the error message before continuing
    - ✅ Fixed function trying to set UIA values multiple times if function is called again shortly after it starts running

⚠️ `discord {`
- ❗All functions are now completely `ImageSearch` free. Meaning discord updates should no longer constantly break these functions!
- `Unread()`
    - 📋 Will now use `PixelSearch` & `UIA` to find; unread `servers`/`channels` & the `Mark as Read` button instead of relying on screenshots
> [!caution]
