```

## > My Scripts
- `^AppsKey:: ;ahksearchHotkey;` will now attempt to check the tab the user opened to see if an error page opened instead.
- Added `#F12:: ;panicExitHotkey;` to run `reload_reset_exit("exit")`
    - Added `#+F12:: ;panicExitALLHotkey;` to run `reload_reset_exit("exit", true)` (includes `checklist.ahk`)
- Added `SC03A & F5:: ;refreshWinHotkey;` to refresh the current active window.

`#c:: ;centreHotkey;` 
- Will now ensure the `monitor` object is actually set before continuing to stop errors
- Fixed bug where if the window was overlapping between a vertical and a horizontal monitor, it would error and fail to center the window

## > Functions
- `reload_Reset()` changed to `reload_reset_exit()` and can now close all active ahk scripts
    - Will ignore `checklist.ahk` by default but can have it included by setting its second parameter
- `tomshiBasic()` can now pass in font size/weight settings
- `hotkeysGUI()` now uses objects, maps & Arrays to define its values
- `errorLogs()` can now accept an `Error Object` and omit the rest of its parameters
- Fixed `errorLog()` producing log files in the incorrect directory if called from a `timer script`
- Fixed `discUnread()` no longer working on dms due to a change with discord
- Add `libUpdateCheck()` to check for lib file updates
- Add `SplitPathObj()` to wrap `SplitPath` into an object

`updateChecker()`
- Will now correctly stop itself checking for an update when the user has selected that as their setting
- Will no longer provide the changelog in an edit box, instead offering the user the option to show the changelog - if they do, will use `WebView2` to load the github release page
- When the user selects the download button, `DLFile.ahk` is now called to provide realtime download information

`settingsGUI()`
- Can now adjust the `Year` version of `After Effects & Premiere Pro` these scripts look for
- Moved code relating to the generation of the `Edit boxes` to `"..\settingsGUI\editValues.ahk`
- Moved `gameCheckGUI class` to `"..\settingsGUI\gameCheckGUI.ahk`
- Fixed error occuring if `settingsGUI()` was closed while `gameCheckGUI` is open

`activeScripts()`
- Fixed being unable to relaunched if closed with `x` windows button
- Checkboxes, images, and `OnEvents` all generated automatically via a loop instead of manually assigning variables

`refreshWin()`
- Can now determine the filepath of `notepad` & `explorer.exe` windows if the user passes `"A"` to both parameters of the function
    - Added `CapsLock & F5:: ;refreshWinHotkey;` to do that

## > Other Changes
- This release will now be distributed in a compiled `.exe` file that contains;
    - A `.zip` file of the release
    - `HotkeyReplacer.ahk` & `readme.md`
    - `SevenZip.ahk` & `dlls`
    - When the user runs the `.exe` release, these files will be extracted and the `.zip` automatically unzipped. Unnecessary files will then be deleted
- Removed a lot of lingering `location` variables from `Streamdeck AHK` scripts
- Removed reduntant version tracking of some scripts
- Added external libs;
    - `WebView2.ahk` - by thqby
    - `SevenZip.ahk` - by thqby
    - `_DLFile.ahk` - by TheArkive

`checklist.ahk`
- Will no longer pause/suspend `autosave.ahk` while waiting for a project to open, instead opting to pause/suspend itself and run `waitUntil.ahk` to wait until a project is open which will then close & rerun `checklist.ahk` to have it automatically open
- Can now better handle more than the default amount of checkboxes
- Changed `msgboxName()` to `change_msgButton()` to stop incorrect autocomplete in VSCode
