# <> Release 2.16 - Features & Fixes
This update lays the groundwork for any `Premiere` theme to be supported; not just the `darkest` theme. While actual full support is unlikely to ever be a priority in the development of this repo, this update makes it possible in the future to at least offer it as a basic feature if it is ever desired.

> [!Caution]
> If the user uses `PremiereRemote` and isn't doing a clean install, this release requires the user to run `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replacePremRemote.ahk` as some functions have been updated.

## Functions

- ✏️ Added `syncDirectories()`
- ✏️ Added `switchTo.explorerHighlightFile()`

### 📝 `ffmpeg {`
- ✏️ Added `isVideo()`
- 📋 Alert tooltip on completion can now be silenced by setting `doAlert` to `false`

### 📝 `ytdlp {`
- 📋 Alert tooltip on completion can now be silenced by setting `doAlert` to `false`

📍 `download()`
- ✅ Fixed function incorrectly naming some files causing subsequent functionality to fail
- ✅ Fixed function sometimes failing to index correctly causing duplicate downloads to cancel
- 📋 Will attempt to select the downloaded file in the `explorer` window if `openDirOnFinish` is set to `true`

### 📝 `prem {`
- ✅ Fixed `save()` using incorrect logic and incorrectly determining premiere as `busy`
- ✅ Fixed `rippleTrim()` tracking incorrectly

- ✏️ Added `soloVideo()`
- ✏️ Added `swapPreviousSequence()`
- ✏️ Added `closeActiveSequence()`
- 📋 `toggleLayerButtons()` will now wait for some activation hotkeys to be released before continuing
- 📋 `changeLabel()` will no longer focus the timeline if the `Projects` window is the active panel so that the user may still assign labels to sequences
- 📋 Theme selection is now determined automatically (for Premiere versions greater than `v25.0`) using the user's Premiere settings file, or through `settingsGUI()` for versions before `v25.0`
    - ❗ `rbuttonPrem().movePlayhead` no longer requires the user's theme to be passed in as a parameter
> [!Warning]
> Keep in mind only the `darkest` theme has its colours set within `timelineColours {` currently & additionally that basically all `ImageSearch` screenshots across the repo are taken in the `darkest` theme (and with `Accessible Colour Contrast` **disabled**).  
> If you use an alternative theme, please update `Premiere_TimelineColours.ahk`, and take fresh screenshots, then consider submitting a pull request!  
> Currently functionality to swap between multiple theme screenshots does not exist as I do not have the capacity to maintain them myself but I am not against building in that swapping functionality (with disclaimers) if there is a need for it.

📍 `numpadGain()`
- 📋 Will now exit early if no clip is selected instead of needing to timeout
- ❗ `PremiereRemote` is now required

📍 `delayPlayback()`
