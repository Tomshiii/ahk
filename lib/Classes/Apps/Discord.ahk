     * > ⚠️ This function isn't perfect, dealing with the clipboard is sometimes incredibly slow and as such might cause noticeable delay at times, unintended characters appearing, or even just past clipboards being pasted instead of the intended text. I've done my best to avoid these issues as much as possible but at the end of the day windows is windows and there's only so much I can do about it. If I knew a way to detect if text is highlighted or not it might reduce some of these pitfalls, but at the current time I have yet to find a method that works with the discord client. ⚠️
     * - If the passed `char` variable is 2 characters long, the first character will be appended at the beginning of the highlighted text & the second character will be appended to the end of the highlighted text
     * - If the passed `char` variable is 2 characters long & you aren't highlighting anything OR it fails to wait for data, this function will attempt to highlight the chat window and send the hotkey that activated the function (by default)
     * @param {String} char the desired character(s) to wrap the text with. This parameter can be no more than 2 characters long
     * @param {String} onFailSend is the desired character you wish to be sent when `char` is 2 characters long and you aren't highlighting any text
     * @param {Object} timeWait is to set a custom time that each `ClipWait` will wait. Two values **MUST** be passed for this parameter to work correctly, they are; `{first: 0.05, second: 0.1}`. The `first` value is to determine how long the clipboard will wait while attempting to see if the user has anything highlighted. The `second` value is hhow long the clipboard will wait while attempting to add the user's highlighted text.
