This repo is a combination of all the scripts I use almost daily to help with either making content (videos or streaming related), or just speeding up mundane and random interactions with a computer.

A lot of the code in the earliest versions of my scripts was either inspired by, or taken from [Taran from LTT](https://github.com/TaranVH/). His videos on ahk got me into fiddling around with it myself so many thanks. These scripts were then further elaborated on, then transformed into a ahk v2.0 compliant script and now mostly contains my own tinkerings. Any scripts directly from Taran are labeled as such down below in the Explanation section (do note though that I personally have gone through them and made them function in ahk v2.0).

You can watch me use some of these scripts in action while I edit away on twitch when I stream on my bot account:

### AHK Version Information:
This repo is to maintain work on the `ahk v2.0` versions of my scripts. These scripts **_will not_** work in `ahk v1.1`, the only versions of these scripts that will work with `ahk v1.1` are Releases [1.0](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v1.0)/[1.1](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v1.1)/[1.2](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v1.2) in this repo. They are _severely_ outdated, are practically missing all current versions of scripts, and those versions are no longer being maintained but you're free to try and backport any later additions if you're willing.

## QMK Keyboard:
My scripts now have support for a secondary keyboard with [[QMK Keyboard.ahk]](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/QMK%20Keyboard.ahk) which along with the [Hasu USB-USB converter](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=109514.0) OR a custom keyboard along with custom firmware, allows you to use a secondary keyboard or numpad to launch completely different scripts than your main keyboard following [this tutorial by Taran from LTT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEoss4XIgc). Any macros that have been moved to this script can be pulled out and placed in your own scripts without any issues.

## What to do:
1. Download and install [AHK v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) then download [AHK v2.0 Beta](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/).
2. Extract AHK v2.0 beta and rename either the 32bit or 64bit exe to just "AutoHotkey.exe". Then replace the default AutoHotkey.exe (usually found in `C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey`) with your new file from the 2.0 beta
   - Replace `Window Spy.ahk` with a v2.0 version found [here](https://github.com/steelywing/AutoHotkey-Release/blob/master/installer/source/WindowSpy.v2.ahk)
3. Download and install either; (You could technically just edit scripts in notepad if you really wanted to, but I honestly don't recommend it)
   - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
     - Then download and install the [ahk language for notepad++](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=50)
   - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     - Then install an AHK extension within the program for a more complete package.
     - It is recommended you use VSCode as a lot of my variables have dynamic comments that can be viewed across the entire program that could help you understand what is going on.
4. Save these scripts in "`C:\Program Files\ahk\ahk\`" if you want all the directory information to just line up without any editing. (you may have to give this folder permissions within windows so it doesn't harass you about admin privileges all the time)
5. Take a look at [Keyboard Shortcuts.ini](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/KSA) to set your own keyboard shortcuts for programs as well as define coordinates for a large chunk of the imagesearches used within these scripts!
6. Edit, then run any of the .ahk files to then use to your liking!
- If you don't have a secondary keyboard, don't forget to take a look through QMK Keyboard.ahk to see what functions you can pull out and put on other keys!

- Scripts that will work with no tinkering include ->
  - Alt Menu acceleration disabler
  - autodismiss error
#### Then be aware:
- Any scripts that still contain pixel coordinates instead of using variables (in either, `Click`, `MouseMove`, `ImageSearch`, `PixelSearch`, etc) rely not only on my monitor layout or the `coordinate mode` set but also my workspace layout within premiere (or any applicable program) and will not necessarily work out of the box. They will require looking at the individual comments, as well as any accompanying AHK documentation (make sure you look at the ahk [v2.0](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) documentation and **NOT** the [v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) documentation) to get an idea of what is going on, then adjusting accordingly using `Window Spy` which gets installed alongside AHK. (an ahk v2.0 version of window spy can be found [here](https://github.com/steelywing/AutoHotkey-Release/blob/master/installer/source/WindowSpy.v2.ahk))
- All keyboard shortcuts within programs like Adobe Premiere/After Effects/OBS, etc that I need within a macro (eg. `^+5` to `highlight the media browser` within Premiere, or `d` for `select clip at playhead`) are definied within the [Keyboard Shortcuts.ini](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/KSA) file instead of just sending the shortcut itself, which are then assigned variables within the [Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk](https://git.io/Jicuy) script that is then included in other scripts. Edit that ini file with your own keyboard shortcuts (and assign any new values in the ahk script as well) to get things to work.

## Explanation:

#### [Keyboard Shortcuts.ini/Keyboard Shortcut Adjustments.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/KSA)
An ini file/ahk script combo for defining all keyboard shortcuts for programs that are then used within other scripts. Having them defined separately in an ini file allows for easy swapping of hotkeys without needing to dig through each and every macro/function that uses it. You do NOT need to run this ahk file, it is [`#Include(d)`](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_Include.htm) in MS_Functions.ahk

#### [My Scripts.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/My%20Scripts.ahk)
This script is the "central" script if you will. A lot of my windows scripts are here (and a hand full of scripts I use for editing).

#### [QMK Keyboard.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/QMK%20Keyboard.ahk)
A script to allow separate function for my secondary keyboard. A script originally created by [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) that I've heavily modified to work for my own workflow and to function in ahk v2.0 (and cut down to only applicable buttons). Up until [Release v2.2.5.1](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v2.2.5.1) I used a small seconday numpad, but as of [Release v2.2.6+](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/releases/tag/v2.2.6) I use a Planck Ez custom keyboard.
Check out [\Secondary Keyboard Files](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/Secondary%20Keyboard%20Files) for more information on how that works.

#### [Functions.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/Functions.ahk)
A sort of "hub" script that includes all [individual function files](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/Functions) into it so that ***it*** can then be [`#Include(d)`](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_Include.htm) in other scripts. You don't need to manually run this file.
A function is defined similar to;
```autohotkey
/* These are comments that dynamically display information when displayed in VSCode,
but also serve as general comments for anyone else
 This function does something
 @param variableX is a value
 @param variableY is another value
 */
func(variableX, variableY)
{
  code(%&variableX%)
  code(%&variableY%)
}
```
We then [`#Include`](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/_Include.htm) `Functions.ahk` in other scripts so we can simply add `func("variableX", "variableY")` to scripts.

#### [autosave.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/autosave.ahk)
A script that will automatically save an Adobe Premiere Pro project every 5min because its built in autosave is practically useless

#### [Streaming.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/tree/main/Stream)
A script I run as Admin while streaming to allow me to interact with obs via ahk (both need to be on the same elevation to interact).

#### [PC Startup.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/PC%20Startup.ahk)
A script that is run on PC startup to launch all my AHK scripts, as well as deal with some programs I need.

#### [Resolve_Example.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/Resolve_Example.ahk)
An example script for Davinci Resolve that has ported a few things from my premiere scripts to help you get started. This is very rough, thrown together and contains nowhere near the same amount of features.

#### [Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/Alt_menu_acceleration_DISABLER.ahk)
A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to disable the alt menu acceloration unless you _hold_ down the alt key.

#### [autodismiss error.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/autodismiss%20error.ahk)
A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to remove an annoying dialogue box in premiere that treats you like a child.

#### [right click premiere.ahk](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/blob/main/right%20click%20premiere.ahk)
A script from [Taran](https://github.com/TaranVH/) to move the playhead in premiere with the right mouse button.
