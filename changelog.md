# <> Release 2.17.0 - Core Functionality.ahk & Premiere v26 Support
This update introduces some rather large, breaking changes to the functionality of my scripts;
- ❗ __NO MORE SYMLINKS!__
    - This should make installation as well as maintainance far easier for the user.
    - ⚠️ `Lib` files will now be installed to `A_Appdata \tomshi\Lib`
    - ⚠️ Adobe `ImageSearch` folders are now based off my `json` files and as such no longer need to generate individual symlinks per folder
- ❗ Introducing `Core Functionality.ahk`
    - This allows my scripts to share `objects` (ie. `UserSettings`, `prem`, etc) between each other easily and safety via `Mutex` locking. This script __*MUST*__ run before any other scripts.

> [!Caution]
> ###### It is recommended for this release that the user does a completely fresh install of my scripts.

> [!Warning]
> The user will need to ensure they have manually set their `Premiere`/`After Effects` year versions to `2026` within `settingsGUI()` if they have updated from `2025`. The automatic version detection only works for the currently set year. Many functions will fail (including `PremiereRemote`) if the incorrect year version is set.
