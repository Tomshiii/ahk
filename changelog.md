# <> Release 2.16.x - 
> [!Caution]
> If the user uses `PremiereRemote` and isn't doing a clean install, this release requires the user to run `..\Backups\Adobe Backups\Premiere\PremiereRemote\replaceAndReset.ahk` as some functions have been updated.

## Functions
- ✅ Fixed `keys.allWait()` stopping a hotkey too early
- ✅ Fixed `getHotkeys()` incorrectly returning boolean `false` in some circumstances
- 📋 `premUIA_Values {` will now check for stuck keys after completion 

⚠️ `getHotkeysArr()`
- ✅ Fixed function returning <kbd><!</kbd> as `<` & `!` instead of as one hotkey
- ✅ Fixed function being case sensitive when it shouldn't have been
- 📋 Will now return all hotkeys as `vk` values instead of a mix of `vk` and regular strings

⚠️ `prem {`
- ✏️ Added `changeDupeFrameMarkers()`

📍 `toggleEnabled()`
- ✅ Fixed function sometimes not deselecting clips
- ✏️ Now accepts parameter `allExcept` to toggle all tracks *except* the desired track *or* all tracks beyond the `offset` value
- 📋 Can now instantly change multiple tracks if the user places the activation hotkeys correctly. (see the [wiki for more info](<https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk/wiki/Adobe-Functions#premtoggleenabled>))
- 📋 Will now check the initial state of the selection and reattempt any failed toggles
> [!Caution]
> This function requires updated `PremiereRemote` functions.
